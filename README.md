# LearningApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

We've built this Angular project on the foundation of advanced design patterns:

- Component-Based Application
- Dependency Injection
- Observer Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture

We've prioritized clarity and type safety by avoiding the 'any' type. Our reliance on services facilitates seamless connections between components, ensuring a cohesive learning experience.

Icons aren't just for showâ€”they enhance navigation and comprehension. Forms are a breeze, thanks to Angular's robust form features, ensuring a smooth learning journey. Plus, we've optimized performance by steering clear of using functions in HTML to rerender multiple times.
